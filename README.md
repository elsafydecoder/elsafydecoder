### Soy Elsafy Hegazy! Hola ðŸ‘‹

My name is Elsafy Hegazy. Programming and problem solving have been always one of the most enjoyable skills I use on a daily basis. with lots of projects and initiatives I've worked on, I currently work as a trainer for a well-known company. Besides, I'm running a somewhat popular youtube channel to help others learn Coding Skills, Web Scraping, Automation, Web Development and Desktop Development as well. I've taught lots and lots of students to write well-designed Programming code. I've been involved in teaching other students to write their web apps using Flask and Django. With almost 7 years of experience in Networking, Information and Cyber Security, Web Scraping and Python Mentoring, I believe coding and programming education should be accessible to everyone.
